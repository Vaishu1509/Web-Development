            <p class = 'intro'> 
                <br><br><br><quote>India observes National Doctor’s Day on July 1. The day is marked to honour the immense contribution that doctors make in our everyday lives. The date of July 1 was decided to mark the day as it is the birth and death anniversary of Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy. Dr Roy was not only a great doctor but was also the second Chief Minister of West Bengal.

                In order to honour his immense contribution and commitment to the noble profession, July 1 is celebrated as National Doctor’s day in India. America on the other hand celebrates the National Doctor’s day on March 30.

                Ever since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country the doctors have been working round the clock in order to save the lives of people. In the process, many committed doctors succumbed to the deadly virus, which they contracted during their work. However, this has not impacted the people in the field as they continue to make efforts for treating each person.


                Initially, when there was no clarity regarding the treatment of coronavirus, many doctors used their experience and treated patients with medicines used for different diseases to cure them of the virus. In fact, there was a time when the doctors and people working in the hospitals did not even have sufficient personal protective equipment, yet they did not step back from their duty and continued their service for the larger good of the society.

                        <quote><b>Dr Sushant Chhabra</b>, Consultant and Head, Department of Emergency Medicine, Manipal Hospital, New Delhi. Dr Chhabra has handled over 2,000 COVID-19 patients since the start of the pandemic in March, 2020 and he believes, one of the biggest challenges for him has been maintaining mental wellbeing when surrounded with all kinds of negative emotions – chaos, distress, sadness, and helplessness.We (healthcare workers) too broke down many times as it was emotionally traumatic amid this chaotic environment and there is this guilt of not being able to help people even when you want to, because of lack of resources, said Dr Chhabra.</<quote>

                        <br><br><br><b><quote>Dr Mehta</b> has been involved in the care delivery of over 2,400 patients with him being available 24×7 at least on phone. Sharing his work routine, Dr Mehta said, We did not have the luxury of having a day off, as we were under-staffed, there was significant fear and attrition in the medical staff due to personal issues and COVID infection. Though in principle we would try to take Sunday off, the phone was on, available and engaged all seven days of the week, every waking hour. When admissions were at their peak, there were only two aspects to life, COVID and sleep. The downtime came in the inter-pandemic period and if one got COVID which was like an escape.</<quote>

Meals, playtime with my kids and even sleep were inadvertently interrupted by calls from the hospital, frantic calls from friends and relatives pleading for help for a hospital bed, medicines or advice.

                        <quote><b>Dr Agarwal</b> has been involved in both COVID testing and looking after COVID isolation centre and was also giving online consultation for free. Since Dr Agarwal was on COVID duty throughout, she had to stay away from her family to protect them from catching the virus in any way. And living away from the family during the crisis did make her feel lonely. However, Dr Agarwal, who is also a food blogger turned to cooking and food styling and photographing food to keep herself busy during the isolation period following 14 days of shift.

                        41-year-old, Dr Tukaram Jamale, Professor and Head of Department of Nephrology, KEM Hospital, Mumbai resonated with Dr Agarwal and said,

                        My wife, Dr Prajakta, is working in Kasturba Hospital she is also managing COVID patients. We have two young daughters – 2-year-old and 8-year-old and as a couple, it became extremely cumbersome for us to manage both home and patients. The situation was emotionally draining; we faced stress both at home and work.</<quote>

                        There are no friends in COVID, families also stay away, and for the first time we have people in hospitals all alone with only health care staff taking care of them. To add to this, seeing large numbers of people dying has been demoralising and difficult to deal with, for most healthcare professionals.
                        While talking about patient care, Dr Gilada emphasised on the missing ‘healing touch’ due to COVID. Elaborating more on it, she said,

                        In pre-COVID times, short chats with patients beyond their illness, just holding their hands or patting their back went such a long way in making the patient feel better. But this completely changed because of PPE (personal protective equipment) suits. Patients are not even able to see our smiles and are left all by themselves without their family when they probably need their support the most.</<quote>
